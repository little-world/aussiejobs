Working for the not for profit sector means you are welcomed into something good on a day to day basis. If you look across the sector many of the people who have made an exceptional career out of fundraising have started in face to face or phone fundraising. Why is this? The simple fact is that most charities now realise regular giving is the cornerstone to fundraising and face to face acquisition is the largest provider of regular givers to the sector.

The station has been in the Smith family since 1953, and was originally owned by Tony’s father, Clem Smith. Initially devoted to sheep shearing, the station ventured into tourism in 1968, when the first cabins were opened and sheep shearing demonstrations began. \n\nTony and Julieanne took over Rawnsley Park in 1985 and, since then, have transformed a small, struggling sheep station into an award-winning tourism facility that attracts 20,000 visitors each year. Though tourism is the main industry on the property, the Station still runs 2000 sheep.\n\nActive members of the South Australian tourism industry, Tony and Julieanne are passionate about the Flinders Ranges and the tourism opportunities it presents. They were one of the first tourism operators in South Australia to gain official ecotourism accreditation and have won multiple State and National Tourism Awards.\n\nCommitted to environmentally responsible and sustainable tourism, Tony and Julieanne have entered into a Heritage Agreement with the South Australian Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources to protect the diverse vegetation of Rawnsley Bluff. Their substantial financial investment into the Rawnsley Park eco-villas over the past decade is further evidence of this commitment. \n\nAvid travellers, Tony and Julieanne have explored much of the Australian Outback and enjoy summer holidays by the sea. They have three adult sons, all of whom have been raised at Rawnsley Park Station.","skillsOrPermitsNeeded":"","intensityOfJob":"","teamDescription":"","accomdationIncluded":false,"transportIncluded":false,"foodIncluded":false,"trainingProvided":false,"rating":8,"verified":false,"visible":true,"isAlwaysOpen":true},{"id":5,"uuid":"5qtzbvnrlem3k37xno5jv7il5","timestamp":1543605740582,"name":"Genius Direct","jobType":"office","address":"20 commercial road","postcode":"","website":"www.geniusdirect.com.au","telephone":"1300829781","harvast":"","latitude":-37.8443809,"longitude":144.97990000000001,"city":"melbourne","email":"info@geniusdirect.com.au","openDateFrom":"","openDateTo":"","function":"","workingHours":"part-time","wages":0,"wagesTimeUnit":"hour","startDate":"1","endDate":"5","numberOfDays":0,"descriptionOfHours":"","secondYearsVisum":false,"contract":false,"canApplyTogether":false,"jobDescription":"The basic fundamentals of Genius Direct's business is its great people!\n \nWe fully recognize that our people are our greatest asset.

In fact, Avonlea Flowers is Australia’s leading producer of Lisianthus and Gypsophila. Lisianthus is picked from spring through to autumn, and Gypsophila is picked year-round.  We've also grown to have more than 10 hectares undercover over two locations, and more than 30 crops grown throughout the year, making us the largest cut flower growing operation in Australia.\nAs well as these crops, Avonlea Flowers produces Lilies from autumn through to spring, Stocks, Snapdragon and Kale during the winter months and disbudded Chrysanthemums for Mothers’ Day, among smaller mixed varieties and trials for the Melbourne and Sydney Markets. We feel that, along with our staff and professionalism, our location is one of our greatest strengths. The semi-arid inland climate is somewhat unique in the Australian cut-flower industry. \nThrough meticulous consideration over the years, we have selected the types and varieties of flowers that best

WE ARE\n\n \n\nWith very little technology (one old laser printer, one Apple Mac SE 30 computer with a laughable 40 mb hard drive, a black and white screen that was so small you could barely see anything, and one telephone line), located in a lounge room, Conquest Recruitment Group (formerly known as Conquest Personnel) was conceived – 20 years ago, this year!\n\n \n\nFrom humble beginnings, we grew to where we are today – the outsourced recruitment arm to many organisations. Having started with very little, nothing got in our way to grow and help give our loyal clients the staff they need. With many obstacles coming our way, we just persevered because if you don’t try you can’t win!

As well as its wines, restaurant and Ministry of Chocolate café, Mitchelton also became known as a destination for outdoor concerts in a spectacular setting ‘on the green’.

Work typically commences at dawn or soon after, and finishes mid-afternoon, but some jobs may require longer shifts.\n\nNormally there is a large amount of paperwork required prior to being allowed to commence work. Most farms will perform an induction on the first day. It is imperative that prior to arriving in the region that an international worker has applied for a tax file number, has set up a bank account, preferably set up a superannuation account, and have your passport with you on arrival.\n\nAlways arrive to work at least 10 minutes prior to commencement and always strictly adhere to meal break times.

The Dysart Name Meaning derives from original Scottish: habitational name from any of various places ie mining workers coming in from all other places.   Dysart shares its name with the town of Dysart in Scotland, also a coal mining town. \n\nIn Dysarts’ case the town was established as a dormitory town for three local coal mines - Saraji in 1973, Norwich Park in 1977 and the Harrow Creek trial colliery which has since ceased operations.  The largest open cut Coking Coal Mine in Australia at Peak Downs was established already nearby in 1972. \n\nThe Dysart area was first explored by German born Ludwig Leichardt. Leichardt arrived in Australia in 1842 at the age of 29. In passing through the Broadsound Shire, Leichardt erected on top of Campbell’s Peak a small cairn of stones, approximately 14 kilometres west of where the town of Dysart now stands, and this can still be seen. \n\nIt was Leichardt who first made reference to coal deposits in central Queensland.

The job qualifies for regional rural work towards your second year visa in Australia, as it includes elements of farm work.\n\nBasically we're looking for a responsible, independent, creative and hard working individual to work at our farm for a minimum period of three months, ideally from the start of November this year.\n\nA bit about us - we're a young international team running a free range pig, sheep and cattle farm in a really beautiful part of Tasmania. The farm is called Mount Gnomon Farm, there are plenty of images on our Facebook page and Instagram accounts, or you can learn more through our website. The farm is really a little community where we combine to run a paddock to plate business. We think it’s a pretty special place and a great opportunity for the right individuals.\n\nThe farm is 9km from the cute seaside village of Penguin in Tassie's north-west, and it's right next to a mountain range that's great for bushwalking and mountain biking. We're just over 1.5 hours away from Cradle Mountain. Technically, if our pigs escaped they could walk all the way to Cradle and only have to cross one road!\n\nWe're doing things a bit different to conventional farmers: we keep old-fashioned breeds that are at risk of extinction and we look after the whole process from paddock to plate. We also go to farmers' markets around Tasmania every weekend to sell our sausages and other meat, and we attend food and music festivals where we make our famous pulled pork tacos and smokey beef and bacon burgers.\n\nThe chef position will follow in the footsteps of other young, international chefs who have enjoyed the challenge and freedom of creating their own menus in our pop-up restaurant, along with learning some butchery and small-good skills. As a chef, you will play a lead role in establishing and improving our kitchen garden, preparing dishes for farmers' markets, food festivals and functions (such as weddings, family gatherings), and be the chef in our pop-up restaurant, which we plan to open on a more regular base this summer. The work will be varied and as a member of the team, you will also get some hands-on farm and kitchen gardening experience.\n\nThe position requires you to be a leader and work independently as well as a member of a team. It's a great job for the right person. Our previous chefs have had a great experience at the farm. Some of their dishes and menus can be viewed on our Facebook and Instagram accounts.\n\nThe position is full time, based at the farm and at the pastoral award rate minus food and accommodation. The successful applicant will also have access to a car for exploring Tasmania with the rest of our team on days off.\n\nPlease apply outlining why you feel like you would be suited to the position and joining our farm community along with some information about the relevant experiences. It is essential to include one professional referee and one personal referee and your telephone number so we can follow up.\n\nAll the best\n\nGuy\nFarm Manager","skillsOrPermitsNeeded":"","intensityOfJob":"","teamDescription":"","accomdationIncluded":false,"transportIncluded":false,"foodIncluded":false,"trainingProvided":false,"rating":0,"verified":false,"visible":true,"isAlwaysOpen":true},{"id":229,"uuid":"eaefrez3vkdbawj0xjgs009n6","timestamp":1543829302533,"name":"The Dog Shed","jobType":"retail","address":"1 Taywood Close","postcode":"","website":"https://www.dogshedgroomingschool.com.au","telephone":"(08) 9582 1100","harvast":"","latitude":-32.691107,"longitude":115.655598,"city":"Bouvard Mandurah","email":"dogshed@southwest.com.au","openDateFrom":"","openDateTo":"","function":"Dog grooming","workingHours":"full-time","wages":0,"wagesTimeUnit":"hour","startDate":"","endDate":"","numberOfDays":0,"descriptionOfHours":"","secondYearsVisum":false,"contract":false,"canApplyTogether":false,"jobDescription":"","skillsOrPermitsNeeded":"","intensityOfJob":"","teamDescription":"","accomdationIncluded":false,"transportIncluded":false,"foodIncluded":false,"trainingProvided":false,"rating":0,"verified":false,"visible":true,"isAlwaysOpen":true},{"id":230,"uuid":"4yq7uy6lj39owrt0on8kjltub","timestamp":1543837867964,"name":"CozWine","jobType":"jobagent","address":"31 Murray Street","postcode":"","website":"cozwine.com.au","telephone":"08 8562 4892","harvast":"","latitude":-34.471841,"longitude":138.996014,"city":"Nuriootpa","email":"barossa@cozwine.com.au","openDateFrom":"","openDateTo":"","function":"wine","workingHours":"","wages":0,"wagesTimeUnit":"","startDate":"","endDate":"","numberOfDays":0,"descriptionOfHours":"","secondYearsVisum":false,"contract":false,"canApplyTogether":false,"jobDescription":"CozWine recruits entry level through to senior people for Australia’s leading wine companies and their suppliers.\n\nOur clients rely on us to find people with the right skills, experience and passion for the wine industry.\n\nWe take the time to match your work requirements, ranging from shift preferences to location considerations and travel time.

Please read all the information on this website before calling. Please phone on Tuesdays between 11am and 12 noon - the phone will not be answered if we do not need pickers. PLEASE PHONE FOR PICKING AND PACKING WORK - PLEASE DO NOT EMAIL. We like to talk to you on the phone.\n\nWe employ men and women from the local area as well as people from all around the world. We harvest blueberries throughout the whole year. Generally we require additional pickers from June to January, and a smaller number of pickers at other times of the year.\n\nPlease READ ALL details on this website. We will only accept enquiries about picking work when we need pickers. When we need pickers, enquiries about picking work can be made ONLY between 11 am and 12 noon on Tuesdays on +61-2-6687 8239. We will not accept enquiries at any other time or on any other telephone number. Do not call the office, do not email and do not visit the farm.\n\nWork Conditions\n\nFruit picking work is gentle physical outdoor work. The area between the rows of blueberry bushes is mown grass. You walk along your allocated rows of blueberries selecting the ripe fruit and gently placing them in a small bucket strapped to your waist. Blueberry bushes are kept pruned to about 1.5 metres high so there is little bending and no ladder work. However, it will often be hot and some people find it tedious.\n\nWork Hours\nBlueberries cannot be picked when they are wet. Therefore, picking does not begin until the morning dew has dried from the berries - usually about 8:30 or 9 am. Picking continues until about 4 pm or later in summer. Picking is mostly done from Monday to Friday but occasionally you may be offered Saturday or Sunday picking, especially if wet weather has stopped picking during the week.\n\nThere is no picking on wet or rainy days.\n\nPay Rates\nWe pay on a piece rate per tray basis (the more berries you pick the more we pay you).\n\nQuality\nPicking quality is extremely important. You will be trained so that you know how to pick and sort quality fruit. The first quality berry rate is only paid for first quality picking.\n\nIf you haven't picked blueberries before it usually takes 7-10 days to get your quality and speed up. New pickers should be prepared to give themselves at least a week, and not give up in the first day or so. Pickers find that improving quality and speed is more mental than physical - they are surprised how easy it becomes.\n\nAccommodation\nThere is no accommodation available on or near the orchard. However, a variety of accommodation options are located 15-30 minutes away in Byron Bay, Suffolk Park, Lennox Head, Ballina and Lismore.\n\nEnquiries about Picking Work\nIf you wish to be considered for picking work you must already have accommodation in the area, and you must have a car because there is no reliable public transport.\n\nBefore calling, please READ ALL details on this website.\nEnquiries about picking work can ONLY be made between 11 am and 12 noon on Tuesdays on +61-2-6687 8239. We will not accept enquiries at any other time or on any other telephone number. Do not call the office, do not email and do not visit the farm. \nRead the Employee Personal Details form.\n\nIf you are a visitor from overseas, read the Entitlement to Work form (see www.immi.gov.au for further details.)\n\nOrientation for Picking Work\n\nIf we ask you to come for orientation for picking:\n\nYou MUST BRING ALL THE DETAILS required on the forms (especially your bank details, your tax file number and your passport number). Be ready to stay the whole day and pick after orientation and training. You will need protective clothing and food and water.","skillsOrPermitsNeeded":"","intensityOfJob":"","teamDescription":"","accomdationIncluded":false,"transportIncluded":false,"foodIncluded":false,"trainingProvided":false,"rating":0,"verified":false,"visible":true,"isAlwaysOpen":true},{"id":237,"uuid":"6b9ql14m60nwjb6bh96xnt6sv","timestamp":1543838582465,"name":"Australian Fruit Producer","jobType":"farming","address":"Rishworth La,","postcode":"","website":"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Australian-Fruit-Producers/210649915972096","telephone":"(02) 6687 8009","harvast":"","latitude":-28.735481,"longitude":153.494565,"city":"Brooklet","email":"","openDateFrom":"","openDateTo":"","function":"apples","workingHours":"","wages":0,"wagesTimeUnit":"","startDate":"","endDate":"","numberOfDays":0,"descriptionOfHours":"","secondYearsVisum":true,"contract":false,"canApplyTogether":false,"jobDescription":"","skillsOrPermitsNeeded":"","intensityOfJob":"","teamDescription":"","accomdationIncluded":false,"transportIncluded":false,"foodIncluded":false,"trainingProvided":false,"rating":0,"verified":false,"visible":true,"isAlwaysOpen":true},{"id":238,"uuid":"5ud8ddmki90jo3dd456w2mk7a","timestamp":1543838662703,"name":"Citrus Contractors Pty Ltd","jobType":"farming","address":"2113 Kulkyne Way","postcode":"","website":"","telephone":"0427 502 743","harvast":"","latitude":-34.442442,"longitude":142.326854,"city":"Nangiloc","email":"","openDateFrom":"","openDateTo":"","function":"grapes","workingHours":"","wages":0,"wagesTimeUnit":"","startDate":"","endDate":"","numberOfDays":0,"descriptionOfHours":"","secondYearsVisum":true,"contract":false,"canApplyTogether":false,"jobDescription":"Contracting company for citrus farms in Nangiloc","skillsOrPermitsNeeded":"","intensityOfJob":"","teamDescription":"","accomdationIncluded":false,"transportIncluded":false,"foodIncluded":false,"trainingProvided":false,"rating":0,"verified":false,"visible":true,"isAlwaysOpen":true},{"id":239,"uuid":"cik074d7ngq77um3bco8a5fzg","timestamp":1543838719123,"name":"Lekakis Grape Harvesting","jobType":"farming","address":"537 Balfour Ogilvy Rd","postcode":"","website":"","telephone":"0418 809 930","harvast":"","latitude":-34.422274,"longitude":140.625214,"city":"Loxton","email":"","openDateFrom":"","openDateTo":"","function":"grapes","workingHours":"","wages":0,"wagesTimeUnit":"","startDate":"","endDate":"","numberOfDays":0,"descriptionOfHours":"","secondYearsVisum":false,"contract":false,"canApplyTogether":false,"jobDescription":"","skillsOrPermitsNeeded":"","intensityOfJob":"","teamDescription":"","accomdationIncluded":false,"transportIncluded":false,"foodIncluded":false,"trainingProvided":false,"rating":0,"verified":false,"visible":true,"isAlwaysOpen":true},{"id":240,"uuid":"8cy574zjp5e0ccfq72rcc6s8a","timestamp":1543838859524,"name":"Tropeano Grape Harvesting","jobType":"farming","address":"","postcode":"","website":"https://www.tropeanoharvesting.com/","telephone":"","harvast":"","latitude":-34.349974,"longitude":146.070709,"city":"Hanwood NSW 2680","email":"tropeanograpeharvesting@gmail.com","openDateFrom":"","openDateTo":"","function":"grapes","workingHours":"","wages":0,"wagesTimeUnit":"","startDate":"0","endDate":"1","numberOfDays":0,"descriptionOfHours":"","secondYearsVisum":false,"contract":false,"canApplyTogether":false,"jobDescription":"TROPEANO GRAPE HARVESTING began as a one machine grape harvesting business 35 years ago.\n\n \n\nErnie and Virginia Tropeano grew the business to incorporate 6 Harvesters, 2 of which convert to Mechanical Pruners, a fleet of Semi Trailers for cartage and a range of machinery to offer Vineyard Contracting Services.\n\n \n\nThis family-owned and operated business has built up a solid reputation for providing a quality and reliable vineyard, harvesting and cartage service.\n\n?\n\nWhile Ernie and  Virginia still oversee business operations, they have been joined by their sons Shannon and Craig and their son-in-law Colin Crossingham.

in 1998 our vineyard produces highly acclaimed Australian Wines from Italian Vines at Uraidla in the Piccadilly Valley in the Adelaide Hills South Australia.\n\nIn 2001 a visit from Dr Alberto Antonini, consultant wine maker and viticulturalist, confirmed the suitability of the site for the varieties we planned to plant. Since then many Italian varieties have been planted and as they mature the wines will reflect our unique terroir. In 2016 Decanter Magazine named Alberto as one of the world’s top five winemakers.\n\nOur varieties include Vermentino, Prosecco, Moscato-Giallo, Dolcetto, Lambrusco Maestri, Sangiovese and Brachetto.\n\nFrom Sicily we have Grillo and Nero d’Avola. We also have a collection of lesser known Italian varietals for assessment.\n\nabout\nWe respect our environment with earth friendly practices, including introduced beneficial insects for pest control, netting for bird protection at harvest and minimal irrigation. At harvest the grapes are handpicked into small crates and processed in our onsite winery. We don’t make wine for other people and we don’t have our wines made under contract for us by other wineries.\n\nSome wines are made with wild vineyard yeast and others with commercial yeast.\nRed wines are made using terracotta amphora and stainless steel. White wines are made in stainless steel and some fermented on skins in amphora.\nOur wines are bottled under screwcaps for freshness and longevity, no need for a cork screw.","skillsOrPermitsNeeded":"","intensityOfJob":"","teamDescription":"","accomdationIncluded":false,"transportIncluded":false,"foodIncluded":false,"trainingProvided":false,"rating":0,"verified":false,"visible":true,"isAlwaysOpen":true},{"id":326,"uuid":"4ckflge6jkiat17u9lz3iwnsw","timestamp":1543898613126,"name":"Kangaroo Creek Vineyards","jobType":"farming","address":"Cnr Cudlee Creek & Berryhill Rd","postcode":"","website":"https://www.facebook.com/kangaroocreekvineyardlobethal/","telephone":"(08) 8389 8447","harvast":"","latitude":-34.883108,"longitude":138.86325,"city":"Lobethal","email":"djc.kangaroocreek@gmail.com","openDateFrom":"","openDateTo":"","function":"grapes","workingHours":"","wages":0,"wagesTimeUnit":"","startDate":"","endDate":"","numberOfDays":0,"descriptionOfHours":"","secondYearsVisum":false,"contract":false,"canApplyTogether":false,"jobDescription":"Strawberry Farm & Cellar Door in Lobethal.

Kirrihill is a progressive and innovative wine business dedicated to producing exceptional quality wines. Our story began as vineyard developers and owners of vineyard holdings throughout the Clare region and into other premium cool climate regions such as the Adelaide Hills. As we continued to grow and develop our vineyard projects through the 90’s, we watched our vineyards mature and the thought of passing over the maturing fruits of our labour became harder to relinquish each vintage.\n\nIn 1999 our determination to realise our vision of Kirrihill Wines was completed with the building of a state of the art winery to complement our now mature vineyard resources in the Clare Valley and Adelaide Hills.

name Thorn-Clarke derives literally from the relationship of two long time Barossa families. Founders David and Cheryl Clarke (nee Thorn) work with their son Sam in this family orientated business. The Thorn-Clarke family has a long history in the Barossa – six generations of involvement in the regions world famous wine industry.\n\nToday the Clarke family is one of the Barossa Valleys largest grape growers and winemakers with 270 hectares of vineyard spread across four sites in the Barossa and Eden Valley. Having grown grapes and sold the fruit to other wineries for a number of years the Thorn-Clarke name is relatively young as a winemaker with the release of the first wines in 2001.\n\nCheryl Clarke’s ancestors settled in the Barossa in the 1870’s and for six generations have been involved in the wine industry. Cheryl’s father Ron Thorn’s property has some of the oldest Shiraz vineyards in Australia and possibly the world on the Thorn family property ‘Clifton’ outside of Angaston. Earliest records show this old vineyard was in existence in 1854.\n\nDavid Clarke’s family were pioneers in the Barossa as well but most famously in the mining of gold from the Barossa Goldfields. One of his ancestors was James Goddard who was responsible for opening the Lady Alice gold mine in the Barossa goldfields and which was the largest gold mine in South Australia at the time. It has been David’s love of the wine industry that saw the planting of the Kabininge vineyard outside of Tanunda in 1987. The planting of the Kabininge vineyard represented the start of a deeper involvement by the family in the Barossa wine industry.","skillsOrPermitsNeeded":"","intensityOfJob":"","teamDescription":"","accomdationIncluded":false,"transportIncluded":false,"foodIncluded":false,"trainingProvided":false,"rating":0,"verified":false,"visible":true,"isAlwaysOpen":true},{"id":340,"uuid":"3wrdkepcibdwgrlb61pszouxv","timestamp":1543899287365,"name":"Golden Grape Estate Pty Ltd","jobType":"farming","address":"606 Hawthorn Rd,  VIC","postcode":"","website":"","telephone":"(03) 9596 4528","harvast":"","latitude":-37.901774,"longitude":145.01887,"city":"Brighton East","email":"","openDateFrom":"","openDateTo":"","function":"apples","workingHours":"","wages":0,"wagesTimeUnit":"","startDate":"","endDate":"","numberOfDays":0,"descriptionOfHours":"","secondYearsVisum":false,"contract":false,"canApplyTogether":false,"jobDescription":"","skillsOrPermitsNeeded":"","intensityOfJob":"","teamDescription":"","accomdationIncluded":false,"transportIncluded":false,"foodIncluded":false,"trainingProvided":false,"rating":0,"verified":false,"visible":true,"isAlwaysOpen":true},{"id":341,"uuid":"2l96zlc5oq7b7zqaz2jmcfyzh","timestamp":1543899349851,"name":"The Grape Unknown","jobType":"farming","address":"221 Clarendon St,  VIC","postcode":"","website":"","telephone":"(03) 9699 4433","harvast":"","latitude":-37.831003,"longitude":144.959954,"city":"South Melbourne","email":"","openDateFrom":"","openDateTo":"","function":"apples","workingHours":"","wages":0,"wagesTimeUnit":"","startDate":"","endDate":"","numberOfDays":0,"descriptionOfHours":"","secondYearsVisum":false,"contract":false,"canApplyTogether":false,"jobDescription":"","skillsOrPermitsNeeded":"","intensityOfJob":"","teamDescription":"","accomdationIncluded":false,"transportIncluded":false,"foodIncluded":false,"trainingProvided":false,"rating":0,"verified":false,"visible":true,"isAlwaysOpen":true},{"id":342,"uuid":"8lvgz82d0certmbahj81863lk","timestamp":1543899406113,"name":"The Cherry Branch","jobType":"farming","address":"Shp2/ 386 Warburton Hwy","postcode":"","website":"https://www.facebook.com/pg/thecherrybranchwandin/about/?ref=page_internal","telephone":"(03) 5964 3437","harvast":"","latitude":-37.78022,"longitude":145.427738,"city":"Wandin North","email":"thecherrybranch@outlook.com","openDateFrom":"","openDateTo":"","function":"Cherries","workingHours":"","wages":0,"wagesTimeUnit":"","startDate":"","endDate":"","numberOfDays":0,"descriptionOfHours":"","secondYearsVisum":false,"contract":false,"canApplyTogether":false,"jobDescription":"Suppliers of quality fresh fruit and vegetables with generations of experience in the industry.

and Rosemary Tabak first began growing raspberries at their Glenburn farm in 1983, which they appropriately named 'Berry King'. Specialising in raspberries, they initially had seven different species, or 'cultivars' as they are known in the world of berries, but would experiment over the years with as many as thirteen different cultivars at once. \n\n\nThe farm would go on to grow loganberries, boysenberries, Silvan blackberries, blueberries and blackcurrants and by 1985 the Tabaks had begun making pickles and making their own jams. Michael would run an experimental orchard where he attempted developing fruits and berries for Australian conditions, and would grow plums, cherries, more varieties of blackberries as well as more exotic fruit like Nashi pears.\n\n             After a very short time both Michael and Rosemary Tabak would become prominent names in the Australian berry-growing field, leading to Rosemary becoming the secretary of the Victorian Rubus Growers Association and Michael holding the seat of Chairman of the Australian Berry Growers Federation. \n\n             By the year 1995, the Tabaks bought ownership of Woolaway Farm and continued to market the products so that together Berry King and Woolaway Farm complement one another in the marketplace. Woolaway Farm was especially famous for their Indian-inspired chutneys and relishes. Now in 2015 the Berry King is a well-known brand in Victoria and supplies many homes and businesses with only the highest quality jams, frozen berries and coulis from their factory in Melbourne, which opened a decade ago.","skillsOrPermitsNeeded":"","intensityOfJob":"","teamDescription":"","accomdationIncluded":false,"transportIncluded":false,"foodIncluded":false,"trainingProvided":false,"rating":0,"verified":false,"visible":true,"isAlwaysOpen":true},{"id":501,"uuid":"8ofrwcjv9r0rkwjwwec65d7xp","timestamp":1543941117502,"name":"The Big Berry","jobType":"farming","address":"925 Gembrook Rd","postcode":"","website":"http://www.thebigberry.com.au/","telephone":"(03) 5967 4413","harvast":"","latitude":-37.852182,"longitude":145.59674,"city":"Hoddles Creek","email":"paul@thebigberry.com.au","openDateFrom":"","openDateTo":"","function":"Berries","workingHours":"","wages":0,"wagesTimeUnit":"","startDate":"","endDate":"","numberOfDays":0,"descriptionOfHours":"","secondYearsVisum":true,"contract":false,"canApplyTogether":false,"jobDescription":"The Big Berry is located at Hoddles Creek, some 60km east of Melbourne.

Our working season is starting now! We need harvest workers from mid March through to the end of the year. Other work is available from January through to March, but please call to check availability!\n\nDuring March and April we need people to plant seed for melons and also plant cane. From April through October there is picking of squash, zucchini, melons, chili, cucumber, tomatoes and more! Most work is paid hourly.\n\nFruit and vegetable picking can be a great way to earn money while you are travelling Australia. You get fit, get a great tan and travel while you're doing it! PLUS if you do more than 3 months of harvest work you are able to apply for a one year extension to your working holidaymaker visa!\n\nHow much Money can you earn?\n\nMost vegetables and fruit (eggfruit, zucchini, squash, chilli, tomato, rockmelons): approx. $20 per hour (before tax). Some jobs will pay more, some will pay on contract – it all depends what is available when you are here.\n\nMangos, pumpkins and watermelons are usually paid on contract - the amount depends on the farm and the size of the bin however a good picker can earn around $150 a day or MUCH more! Mango packing is normally paid at approx. $18 per hour (before tax).\n\nThe hours you will work each day depend on the weather - some days you may work 10 hours or more, others you may only work 4 or 5 hours. Most farms work 7 days a week during the season.\n\nWhat do you need?\n\nWorking Holidaymaker Visa (subclass 417)\nTax File Number\nAustralian bank account\nWorking Clothes and shoes (we sell these at Reception!)\nWater bottle - you need to take AT LEAST 5 litres of water per day\nSunscreen\nAnd a good attitude to hard work.\n\n\nHarvest Trail work – information on your health, tax, superannuation and more!\n\nWanting to hit the harvest trail?\n\n\n\nHarvest work is HARD WORK! Yep, you get a tan, you usually work outside, you get fit and you can often work long hours or on contract to earn more money. But it can also be hot, heavy, dirty and physically challenging. You really need the right attitude to it and if you don’t think you’re up to the job, then you probably won’t be.\n\n\n\nBe Prepared for Work\n\nMuch of the work is located in smaller regional areas – before you spend time and cash travelling to these places, a little thought and research may help you to get the best out your harvest trail experience. \n\n\n\nCall ahead! At Delta, we try to give honest information about work availability. Be aware that it is difficult for Delta (and all working hostels!) to predict work availability – work depends on the farms, the weather, how many others check in before you on the wait list and even moon cycles! Be prepared to wait for work. We will always tell you if we think there will be a wait for work.\n\nMost farmers want staff for at least one or two weeks. Picking, planting and packing DO require training and some skill so the growers prefer staff who stay longer!\n\n\nBefore you start you will need to arrange some or all of the following:\n\nA valid Australian work visa (subclass 417)\nA signed Tax Declaration form for EACH farm that you work on. You have 28 days to give your Tax File Number (TFN) to the farm – if you don’t provide it, you will be taxed at the max tax rate of 30%....crikey!\nAn Australian bank account. Some farms pay by cheque or cash, but make sure you always take your bank account details to a new job – that way you will always be paid on time\n\n\n· Proper work clothes: \n\nClosed shoes. Most harvest work will not allow thongs or sandals.\nLong pants (depending on job)\nLng sleeved shirt or arm protectors. A thin long sleeved shirt will protect you from sunburn in summer – you will be amazed at just how quickly your skin will fry in the harsh Aussie sun.\nGloves (depending on job)\nSunscreen\nAt least 5 litres of water!!! The Aussie sun is HOT!\nLunch\n\nWe sell work clothes in Reception! You can also get cheap working clothes from op shops (second hand clothes stores mostly run by charities) – you will probably be able to pick up clothes for only a couple of dollars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Working\n\n\n\nIt will take around 3 days to used to the harvest work physically. Be prepared to ache and grumble for the first few days! After around day 4, your body will adjust to the work and it will be easier. If you can make it past those first few days, then you’re set! Tiger Balm is fantastic for muscle aches and can be bought at Reception as well as pharmacies and supermarkets. Try some basic back stretches before and after work as well – see if anyone at the hostel knows yoga and get them to show you some stretches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaxes\n\n\n\nWhile working, you WILL pay tax and superannuation. It’s important to keep a record of the farms that you’ve worked on, and the superannuation funds that you’ve joined in order to be able to claim this money back when you leave. Keep a list of farms, their contact number and their ABN and the superannuation fund they had you join – and better yet, keep your payslips. This information will also then be used for filling out the all important Working Holiday Visa extension application! \n\nYou are allowed to work for up to 6 months for the same employer, but there are no limits on the length of time that you work during your time as a working holidaymaker. \n\n\n\nIf you are having problems with your pay, please see your supervisor at the farm first. If you think you are being paid or treated unfairly at work then you can contact the Department of Industrial Relations and they can provide advice to you.\n\n\n\nYour Health\n\nWorking in the Aussie sun – even in winter – puts heat stress on your body. You will dehydrate quickly so take at least 5 litres of water to work and aim to drink more in summer. If you are working in heat above 32°C then you should drink an extra ½ to one litre (2 to 4 cups) of water per hour.\n\nIf you sweat out more water than you drink, you will dehydrate. Signs of dehydration include:\n\nfatigue / weakness / dizziness / light headedness\nloss of appetite\ndry mouth\nheadache\nburning in the stomach\n\n\nOften thirst is one of the later symptoms of dehydration and heat stress so you need to make sure you drink often and plenty! Dehydration can quickly become severe but is very easy to prevent. Just because you aren’t thirsty doesn’t mean you aren’t dehydrated! Remember also that alcohol dehyrdrates – so if you’ve been drinking the night before work then you will need to be more conscious about drinking water. Most hangover symptoms are due to dehydration (see the list above) so if you are suffering drink water, water and then some more water!\n\nWear light weight clothing that will help air to circulate – this will help to keep you cooler and also help prevent heat stress.\n\nBe aware of sunburn – just because it’s cool and cloudy DOES NOT mean that you won’t be red and sunburned! Always wear sunscreen and a hat, and light long sleeves in summer will help to protect your skin. A tan is great, but looking like an old pair of leather boots isn’t quite as cool. \n\n\n\nFinishing Work / Leaving the Country\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve finished working (whooohooo!) then you need to plan your tax return. Many backpackers will find that they are able to claim back all or most of the tax they’ve paid while working... You will need to lodge a tax return through the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) using a Taxpack, which is available from most newsagents. There are also companies which advertise in most backpacker magazines who will organise it for you. If you have a decent grasp of English, it’s actually pretty simple to do it yourself and you will save the commission. You should also be able to get back the superannuation that you paid while working.\n\n\n\nHarvest work can be hard – but staying in a working hostel for a period of time gives you a chance to save money and develop deeper friendships with other travellers than you would when you are on the road – and earning that second year of a working visa is a pretty big bonus as well! As owners of the Delta, we’ve had lots of backpackers tell me that their absolute favourite time in Australia was spent here at Delta – good times with good friends.","skillsOrPermitsNeeded":"","intensityOfJob":"","teamDescription":"","accomdationIncluded":false,"transportIncluded":false,"foodIncluded":false,"trainingProvided":false,"rating":0,"verified":true,"visible":true,"isAlwaysOpen":true},{"id":587,"uuid":"by1kn443wlq7qpq5urshzphpz","timestamp":1544151988192,"name":"Palace Backpackers Childers","jobType":"Working Hostel","address":"Churchill St","postcode":"","website":"","telephone":"(07) 4126 2244","harvast":"","latitude":-25.235196,"longitude":152.274484,"city":"Childers","email":"","openDateFrom":"","openDateTo":"","function":"","workingHours":"","wages":0,"wagesTimeUnit":"","startDate":"","endDate":"","numberOfDays":0,"descriptionOfHours":"","secondYearsVisum":false,"contract":false,"canApplyTogether":false,"jobDescription":"","skillsOrPermitsNeeded":"","intensityOfJob":"","teamDescription":"","accomdationIncluded":false,"transportIncluded":false,"foodIncluded":false,"trainingProvided":false,"rating":0,"verified":false,"visible":true,"isAlwaysOpen":true},{"id":588,"uuid":"2lde5yvfalc9bzitr6ixb5f7r","timestamp":1544152069299,"name":"Secluded Springs","jobType":"Working Hostel","address":"230 Foleys Road","postcode":"","website":"http://www.secludedsprings.com.au/","telephone":"(07) 4126 9129","harvast":"","latitude":-25.068461,"longitude":152.255597,"city":"Childers","email":"","openDateFrom":"","openDateTo":"","function":"","workingHours":"","wages":0,"wagesTimeUnit":"","startDate":"","endDate":"","numberOfDays":0,"descriptionOfHours":"","secondYearsVisum":false,"contract":false,"canApplyTogether":false,"jobDescription":"Secluded Springs is a family-run, farmstay hostel in the Bundaberg / Childers area that caters for romantic getaways, families, backpackers, workshops and special events.

Sometimes what there is may be dependant on what day you actually arrive, since jobs start when they do, not when you get here.\n\nJanuary through to late April is the peak time for table, dried and wine grape picking, trimming and packing. June to August is the time for citrus picking and packing and vine work such as pulling out, trimming and rolling on.   September to January sees nursery work, vine planting, general farm labouring work, pruning of new growth and trimming of bunches and vine covering. There may also be some late orange picking and other tasks to set up for the new crop of grapes and dried fruit.\n\nAdditionally, at different times of the year there may be jobs picking and packing vegetables or fruit such as capsicum, apricots, beans, melons, pumpkins Worker 2and asparagus.\n\nWe will do our best to find work for you when you stay with us and for a small charge towards costs each day we will generally provide transport to and from the work place.\n\nIt is almost always easier to get work if you are already staying at Mildura International Backpackers as it is rare that we accept a job that we cannot fill with someone already staying with us. We won't tell you to come if we don't honestly think there will be something available based on what farmers tell us .... but understand that sometimes situations change and the work doesn't go ahead, sometimes you might just miss out on something because of what day you arrive and sometimes it is just a quiet period for work.\n\nUnderstand that Mildura in spring, summer and autumn can be hot and dusty and in winter can be cold and that farm work is not for everyone, it requires you to be fit and healthy and reliable. If you cannot handle repetitive physical work and cannot commit to being reliable we suggest you think about finding a job or location more suited to your abilities.","skillsOrPermitsNeeded":"","intensityOfJob":"","teamDescription":"","accomdationIncluded":false,"transportIncluded":false,"foodIncluded":false,"trainingProvided":false,"rating":0,"verified":false,"visible":true,"isAlwaysOpen":true},{"id":609,"uuid":"56wmf8cum6xby6inl72i95yt8","timestamp":1544155044993,"name":"Riviera Backpackers Motel","jobType":"Working Hostel","address":"157 7TH Street","postcode":"","website":"","telephone":"(03) 5023 3696","harvast":"","latitude":-34.181346,"longitude":142.161373,"city":"Mildura","email":"","openDateFrom":"","openDateTo":"","function":"","workingHours":"","wages":0,"wagesTimeUnit":"","startDate":"","endDate":"","numberOfDays":0,"descriptionOfHours":"","secondYearsVisum":false,"contract":false,"canApplyTogether":false,"jobDescription":"","skillsOrPermitsNeeded":"","intensityOfJob":"","teamDescription":"","accomdationIncluded":false,"transportIncluded":false,"foodIncluded":false,"trainingProvided":false,"rating":0,"verified":false,"visible":true,"isAlwaysOpen":true},{"id":610,"uuid":"a0kj31ezmfvaqnaf2wn3bbq5h","timestamp":1543938436666,"name":"Aerie Heights Backpackers","jobType":"Working Hostel","address":"160 Hoddle Street","postcode":"","website":"aerieheightsbackpackers.com","telephone":"0409 554 122","harvast":"","latitude":-37.794637,"longitude":145.607488,"city":"Yarra Junction","email":"aerie-heights@bigpond.com","openDateFrom":"","openDateTo":"","function":"","workingHours":"","wages":0,"wagesTimeUnit":"","startDate":"","endDate":"","numberOfDays":0,"descriptionOfHours":"","secondYearsVisum":false,"contract":false,"canApplyTogether":false,"jobDescription":"Work in the Upper Yarra Valley\nHarvest Work is available from November till April\n\nPicking Berries ( Blueberries, Raspberries, Strawberries )\nPicking Grapes or work as a bucket boy\nPicking Apples, grading Apples\nPicking Peaches and Nectarines\nBulb plantings\nOther work on local orchards as farmhands...\nWork like Pruning, Propagation is possible most of the year.\n\nJust call us and we can tell you whats currently available...","skillsOrPermitsNeeded":"","intensityOfJob":"","teamDescription":"","accomdationIncluded":false,"transportIncluded":false,"foodIncluded":false,"trainingProvided":false,"rating":0,"verified":false,"visible":true,"isAlwaysOpen":true},{"id":611,"uuid":"9nmcq3muujb9mueghxyzckb6t","timestamp":1544155183321,"name":"Dolphin Retreat","jobType":"Working Hostel","address":"14 Wellington Street","postcode":"","website":"http://dolphinretreatbunbury.com.au/","telephone":"(08) 9792 4690","harvast":"","latitude":-33.324045,"longitude":115.633534,"city":"Bunbury","email":"info@dolphinretreatbunbury.com.au","openDateFrom":"","openDateTo":"","function":"","workingHours":"","wages":0,"wagesTimeUnit":"","startDate":"","endDate":"","numberOfDays":0,"descriptionOfHours":"","secondYearsVisum":false,"contract":false,"canApplyTogether":false,"jobDescription":"Please go here: https://mailchi.mp/508fbff70877/are-you-looking-for-work now and we will send you an email everytime we have work for you.

It was during this time that the organisation was directly involved in major projects to contribute to the wider Tamworth community , such as various Skillshare initiatives.\n\n \n\nThe biggest shift for the organisation was the move from training to job placement and employment services, which was brought about by the privatisation of the Commonwealth Employment Service in 1998.  With this change came the name Joblink Plus.\n\n \n\nBetween 1998 and 2008, Joblink Plus continued to grow in size and the amount of services provided to the community, from employment, welfare and youth programs.  Following the Australian Government’s Job Services Australia tender process in 2008-2009, Joblink Plus doubled in size and scope, and covered about 47 per cent of NSW.\n\n \n\nDuring this period Joblink Plus also moved back into the structured training landscape by establishing Joblink Plus Training, a Registered Training Organisation delivering over 25 nationally recognised qualifications.  In 2010, Joblink Plus completed their $3 million state-of-the-art training facility in Tamworth. \n\n \n\nIn 2012 Joblink Plus was successful in tendering to deliver Disability Employment Services (DES), and established \"e-Link\", a self-funded initiative to recycle electronic waste and provide long term unemployed clients with on the job training and industry recognised qualifications.\n\n \n\nJuly 1, 2015 brought the start of a new 5 year contract with the Department of Employment. jobactive is an Australian Government initiative that aims to re-engage job seekers with providers and provide communities with new employment solutions. We have expanded south into Central West, with sites in Orange, Parkes, Bathurst Forbes and more. We are also as far west as Broken Hill, where we offer jobactive and DES. Our connection to Tamworth remains strong with the establishment of SEE Change Cafe located in the Tamworth Regional Youth Centre (The Youthie). Joblink Plus is a consortium member of The Youthie and provides accessible services in a tailored environment.  \n\n \n\nJoblink Plus is now a truly diverse organisation on a large-scale. We remain committed to providing local, tailored and dedicated employment services and solutions to every community that we’re part of.","skillsOrPermitsNeeded":"","intensityOfJob":"","teamDescription":"","accomdationIncluded":false,"transportIncluded":false,"foodIncluded":false,"trainingProvided":false,"rating":0,"verified":false,"visible":true,"isAlwaysOpen":true},{"id":648,"uuid":"f45etyi0wwieg1eq0z3xaxlbq","timestamp":1544191298114,"name":"Adecco","jobType":"jobagent","address":"27/29-31 Hunter Street","postcode":"","website":"Adecco.com.au","telephone":"(02) 9244 3400","harvast":"","latitude":-33.866048,"longitude":151.20904,"city":"Sydney","email":"","openDateFrom":"","openDateTo":"","function":"","workingHours":"","wages":0,"wagesTimeUnit":"","startDate":"","endDate":"","numberOfDays":0,"descriptionOfHours":"","secondYearsVisum":false,"contract":false,"canApplyTogether":false,"jobDescription":"We have a vast network of connections with Australian as well as international companies, and we can help you access all sorts of amazing job opportunities.

It was during this time that the organisation was directly involved in major projects to contribute to the wider Tamworth community , such as various Skillshare initiatives.\n\n \n\nThe biggest shift for the organisation was the move from training to job placement and employment services, which was brought about by the privatisation of the Commonwealth Employment Service in 1998.  With this change came the name Joblink Plus.\n\n \n\nBetween 1998 and 2008, Joblink Plus continued to grow in size and the amount of services provided to the community, from employment, welfare and youth programs.  Following the Australian Government’s Job Services Australia tender process in 2008-2009, Joblink Plus doubled in size and scope, and covered about 47 per cent of NSW.\n\n \n\nDuring this period Joblink Plus also moved back into the structured training landscape by establishing Joblink Plus Training, a Registered Training Organisation delivering over 25 nationally recognised qualifications.  In 2010, Joblink Plus completed their $3 million state-of-the-art training facility in Tamworth. \n\n \n\nIn 2012 Joblink Plus was successful in tendering to deliver Disability Employment Services (DES), and established \"e-Link\", a self-funded initiative to recycle electronic waste and provide long term unemployed clients with on the job training and industry recognised qualifications.\n\n \n\nJuly 1, 2015 brought the start of a new 5 year contract with the Department of Employment. jobactive is an Australian Government initiative that aims to re-engage job seekers with providers and provide communities with new employment solutions. We have expanded south into Central West, with sites in Orange, Parkes, Bathurst Forbes and more. We are also as far west as Broken Hill, where we offer jobactive and DES. Our connection to Tamworth remains strong with the establishment of SEE Change Cafe located in the Tamworth Regional Youth Centre (The Youthie). Joblink Plus is a consortium member of The Youthie and provides accessible services in a tailored environment.  \n\n \n\nJoblink Plus is now a truly diverse organisation on a large-scale. We remain committed to providing local, tailored and dedicated employment services and solutions to every community that we’re part of.","skillsOrPermitsNeeded":"","intensityOfJob":"","teamDescription":"","accomdationIncluded":false,"transportIncluded":false,"foodIncluded":false,"trainingProvided":false,"rating":0,"verified":false,"visible":true,"isAlwaysOpen":true},{"id":677,"uuid":"7158euf8wdbxpy8ankbrrtam1","timestamp":1544194183433,"name":"Angel Recruitment","jobType":"jobagent","address":"65/143-149 Corrimal Street","postcode":"","website":"http://angelsrecruit.com/","telephone":"(02) 4228 3900","harvast":"","latitude":-34.429327,"longitude":150.899489,"city":"Wollongong","email":"","openDateFrom":"","openDateTo":"","function":"","workingHours":"","wages":0,"wagesTimeUnit":"","startDate":"","endDate":"","numberOfDays":0,"descriptionOfHours":"","secondYearsVisum":false,"contract":false,"canApplyTogether":false,"jobDescription":"Angels Recruiting Agency is founded out of the need that career choices are life changing and we pride ourselves on placing the right candidate with the right clients.

The Job Shop was born a few days later at the back of Easyrider's, a hop on/ hop off tour business in Perth, WA.\n\n\nOver the past 12 years, The Job Shop has grown into a key player in the agriculture and hospitality recruitment sectors. We opened our second branch in Kununurra in 2006 when we were awarded the Federal Government contract to supply the Harvest Labour Service (HLS) in northwestern WA. We received the HLS contract for the Northern Territory in 2015 and opened offices in Katherine and Darwin.\n\n\nIn 2017 The Job Shop got involved with the Seasonal Workers Program, bringing in workers from Timor Leste, Vanuatu and Tonga to help growers and hospitality clients secure a reliable source of horticultural and hospitality staff who can return on an annual basis.\n\n\nAlthough The Job Shop started as a backpacker-focused operation, we have evolved into a regional recruitment agency offering a range of employment options for temporary workers and Australian residents. Working together with our 4 offices and 7 full-time staff, we provide employment to an average of 3000 people each year.","skillsOrPermitsNeeded":"","intensityOfJob":"","teamDescription":"","accomdationIncluded":false,"transportIncluded":false,"foodIncluded":false,"trainingProvided":false,"rating":0,"verified":false,"visible":true,"isAlwaysOpen":true},{"id":693,"uuid":"ctbfnnmkubn0cih7iymxm5myc","timestamp":1544322108446,"name":"Jobfind","jobType":"jobagent","address":"Spencer Street","postcode":"","website":"https://www.jobfindcentre.com.au","telephone":"(08) 8957 1000","harvast":"","latitude":-22.129779,"longitude":133.413761,"city":"Ti Tree","email":"info@jobfindcentre.com.au","openDateFrom":"","openDateTo":"","function":"","workingHours":"","wages":0,"wagesTimeUnit":"","startDate":"","endDate":"","numberOfDays":0,"descriptionOfHours":"","secondYearsVisum":false,"contract":false,"canApplyTogether":false,"jobDescription":"Jobfind is a leading provider of employment, training, recruitment and post-employment services in Australia.

It became apparent to both Hamish and Ross that there was a need for locum doctor coverage here in the heart of the Australian outback.\n\nOchre Recruitment was born.\n\nExperiencing initial success in the new venture of recruiting rural and outback locums, the Ochre Health group grew, expanding to include rural and remote health care services and management. Rather than just being another recruitment company, the organization became an all-in-one stop for the outback health industry. During our time we have developed a reputation as a market leader, earned over many years of successfully placing doctors in medical jobs through our clear and concise recruitment process, which has enabled us to grow our business to encompass three offices in Australia and, since 2009, in New Zealand.\n\nThis year we established a set of guiding principles, known collectively as \"The Ochre Way\". The Ochre Way codifies the values which Ochre represents, as well as providing a guiding light for the way forward as a company.\n\nOchre Recruitment Values:\n\nCare\nIntegrity\nContinuous Improvement\nEmpowerment\nInnovation\nOchre Recruitment embraces 5 core values that provide direction and clarity about the way we make decisions and achieve our goals. These values build a collaborative working environment in which we provide quality service and solutions to our clients and doctors.\n\nOchre Recruitment has a growing global reach with preferred supplier status with a number of clients. No matter whether you are looking for doctors to fill positions, or you are a doctor looking for work, you will benefit from our strong presence in both domestic and international markets.","skillsOrPermitsNeeded":"","intensityOfJob":"","teamDescription":"","accomdationIncluded":false,"transportIncluded":false,"foodIncluded":false,"trainingProvided":false,"rating":0,"verified":false,"visible":true,"isAlwaysOpen":true},{"id":723,"uuid":"dglubz2lrp391zs63nzggb605","timestamp":1544326091857,"name":"Ross Human","jobType":"jobagent","address":"Unit 3 94 Central Avenue","postcode":"","website":"Rossjuliaross.com","telephone":"(03) 6273 6400","harvast":"","latitude":-42.837787,"longitude":147.301541,"city":"Derwent Park","email":"","openDateFrom":"","openDateTo":"","function":"","workingHours":"","wages":0,"wagesTimeUnit":"","startDate":"","endDate":"","numberOfDays":0,"descriptionOfHours":"","secondYearsVisum":false,"contract":false,"canApplyTogether":false,"jobDescription":"","skillsOrPermitsNeeded":"","intensityOfJob":"","teamDescription":"","accomdationIncluded":false,"transportIncluded":false,"foodIncluded":false,"trainingProvided":false,"rating":0,"verified":false,"visible":true,"isAlwaysOpen":true},{"id":724,"uuid":"6fuexsw3tz4mbm3uy1f5i9lp5","timestamp":1544326154418,"name":"Searson Buck","jobType":"jobagent","address":"183 Macquarie Street","postcode":"","website":"Searsonbuck.com.au","telephone":"(03) 6223 3055","harvast":"","latitude":-42.886599,"longitude":147.324474,"city":"Hobart","email":"info@searsonbuck.com.au","openDateFrom":"","openDateTo":"","function":"","workingHours":"","wages":0,"wagesTimeUnit":"","startDate":"","endDate":"","numberOfDays":0,"descriptionOfHours":"","secondYearsVisum":false,"contract":false,"canApplyTogether":false,"jobDescription":"The Searson Buck team has every stage in your career journey covered\nAs a Tasmanian-based employment agency, Searson Buck works with local employers to secure the right people for the right jobs.\n\nOur close relationships with many of Tasmania’s largest employers gives us the edge – we find out about the most sought after job vacancies first.\n\nWhether you’re considering a new career, are keen to progress, or you want to re-enter the workforce, we can help you take the next step in your career journey.\n\nOur team of specialised recruitment consultants can help you recognise and maximise your personal potential and make the search easier.\n\nCheck out current job vacancies see if anything suits your needs.\n\nSometimes vacant roles don’t even make it to the advertisement stage, so registering increases your chances of securing your next job.

The Captain of the South Midlands team (who ran a Labour Hire business in Gingin WA) was asked \"How are you going Balcy?\" just as he was about to take the field and he replied, \"I'd be better if I could find 20 backpackers\".\n\n\nAfter a few phone calls and meetings, a business plan was scratched out. The Job Shop was born a few days later at the back of Easyrider's, a hop on/ hop off tour business in Perth, WA.\n\n\nOver the past 12 years, The Job Shop has grown into a key player in the agriculture and hospitality recruitment sectors. We opened our second branch in Kununurra in 2006 when we were awarded the Federal Government contract to supply the Harvest Labour Service (HLS) in northwestern WA. We received the HLS contract for the Northern Territory in 2015 and opened offices in Katherine and Darwin.\n\n\nIn 2017 The Job Shop got involved with the Seasonal Workers Program, bringing in workers from Timor Leste, Vanuatu and Tonga to help growers and hospitality clients secure a reliable source of horticultural and hospitality staff who can return on an annual basis.\n\n\nAlthough The Job Shop started as a backpacker-focused operation, we have evolved into a regional recruitment agency offering a range of employment options for temporary workers and Australian residents. Working together with our 4 offices and 7 full-time staff, we provide employment to an average of 3000 people each year.","skillsOrPermitsNeeded":"","intensityOfJob":"","teamDescription":"","accomdationIncluded":false,"transportIncluded":false,"foodIncluded":false,"trainingProvided":false,"rating":0,"verified":false,"visible":true,"isAlwaysOpen":true},{"id":850,"uuid":"bnssaol6jwga3ihyu03k6wjee","timestamp":1544326670213,"name":"Mission Australia","jobType":"jobagent","address":"Shop 15, 12 - 14 Robinson St","postcode":"","website":"https://www.missionaustralia.com.au/","telephone":"(08) 9941 1760","harvast":"","latitude":-24.884804,"longitude":113.656782,"city":"Carnarvon","email":"","openDateFrom":"","openDateTo":"","function":"","workingHours":"","wages":0,"wagesTimeUnit":"","startDate":"","endDate":"","numberOfDays":0,"descriptionOfHours":"","secondYearsVisum":false,"contract":false,"canApplyTogether":false,"jobDescription":"A career with Mission Australia provides the opportunity to be part of a diverse, dedicated and friendly group of people who are passionate about making a difference in the community.

Our wines have been preservative-free now for 10 years and like we mentioned earlier, our main brag is our focus on hitting the perfect balance between a top quality taste and taking care of Mother Earth. \n\nSo…carbon neutrality? How do we do it? Without getting too caught up in complicated science speak, we measure our carbon footprint at each step through keeping track of a wine’s lifecycle from the cradle to gate. We know exactly how much Co2 is being produced by each of our wines and the processes our team undertakes up until that wine is taken off our hands by those who love to drink it. \n\nIt’s naked (our tongue-in-cheek way of saying ‘we’re all natural’) all the way when it comes to management of our vineyards. You’ll find these happy soil patches in Langhorne Creek, Eden Valley and Loxton, playing host to fruit honoured by handling it as little as possible during the winemaking process.  \n\nThe end note? Our dedication to sustainable practices isn’t only for the earth.

It became apparent to both Hamish and Ross that there was a need for locum doctor coverage here in the heart of the Australian outback.\n\nOchre Recruitment was born.\n\nExperiencing initial success in the new venture of recruiting rural and outback locums, the Ochre Health group grew, expanding to include rural and remote health care services and management. Rather than just being another recruitment company, the organization became an all-in-one stop for the outback health industry. During our time we have developed a reputation as a market leader, earned over many years of successfully placing doctors in medical jobs through our clear and concise recruitment process, which has enabled us to grow our business to encompass three offices in Australia and, since 2009, in New Zealand.\n\nThis year we established a set of guiding principles, known collectively as \"The Ochre Way\". The Ochre Way codifies the values which Ochre represents, as well as providing a guiding light for the way forward as a company.\n\nOchre Recruitment Values:\n\nCare\nIntegrity\nContinuous Improvement\nEmpowerment\nInnovation\nOchre Recruitment embraces 5 core values that provide direction and clarity about the way we make decisions and achieve our goals. These values build a collaborative working environment in which we provide quality service and solutions to our clients and doctors.\n\nOchre Recruitment has a growing global reach with preferred supplier status with a number of clients. No matter whether you are looking for doctors to fill positions, or you are a doctor looking for work, you will benefit from our strong presence in both domestic and international markets.","skillsOrPermitsNeeded":"","intensityOfJob":"","teamDescription":"","accomdationIncluded":false,"transportIncluded":false,"foodIncluded":false,"trainingProvided":false,"rating":0,"verified":false,"visible":true,"isAlwaysOpen":true},{"id":1014,"uuid":"4ncv7jqcuqk7akfko5t2cclbq","timestamp":1544326299002,"name":"Searson Buck","jobType":"jobagent","address":"29 Wilson Street, Burnie TAS 7320","postcode":"","website":"https://www.searsonbuck.com.au","telephone":"03 6431 5155","harvast":"","latitude":-41.051391,"longitude":145.907039,"city":"","email":"info@searsonbuck.com.au","openDateFrom":"","openDateTo":"","function":"","workingHours":"","wages":0,"wagesTimeUnit":"","startDate":"","endDate":"","numberOfDays":0,"descriptionOfHours":"","secondYearsVisum":false,"contract":false,"canApplyTogether":false,"jobDescription":"The Searson Buck team has every stage in your career journey covered\nAs a Tasmanian-based employment agency, Searson Buck works with local employers to secure the right people for the right jobs.\n\nOur close relationships with many of Tasmania’s largest employers gives us the edge – we find out about the most sought after job vacancies first.\n\nWhether you’re considering a new career, are keen to progress, or you want to re-enter the workforce, we can help you take the next step in your career journey.\n\nOur team of specialised recruitment consultants can help you recognise and maximise your personal potential and make the search easier.\n\nCheck out current job vacancies see if anything suits your needs.\n\nSometimes vacant roles don’t even make it to the advertisement stage, so registering increases your chances of securing your next job.
